Several farmers have approached us for help. They have a conflict regarding a farm to the northeast.


Arx
- Large older farmer
- Claims to have built most of the farm
- Two farmers have roped him into some stuff

Velnir Kelthor
- Purchased a deed (from us??). 
- Claims Arx is squatting on his land.
- According to deed, the land is owned by:
    - yagrim kelthor
    - velnir rouge
- 

Yagrim Kelthor
- With Velnir

Faust Fuchs
- Young boy, farm hand. Late teens.
- Been working on the farm for a few weeks.

The Deed
- Sold last week.
- Signed by someone who does not exist:
    - Korwin Jervis
- Sold by an individual with shiny eyes, long blonde hair. Like a shiny elf. Fancy clothes.

We sided with Arix and Faust, given that the deed was not legitimate.

Korwin Jervis is an aasimar who stayed around 2-3 days ago, but left to Varnhold. Was seen selling deeds. Left on a horse.

Yagrim and Velnir
- Path to Varnhold is dangerous. Giant spiders??

We put a bounty on Korwin Jervis. Dead: 100gp. Alive: 150gp + a special prize.

We went east to try to find the [[buried treasure|quests.buried-treasure]].

We were attacked by wolf-like creatures. One large one has unusually intelligent red eyes and white fur - a warg. Which is unusual, wargs are typically grey or black. Three are smaller.

Avoar skinned the warg.

We continued eastward and found mossy stone ruins.

The entry chamber has a ton of sleeping bats.

A black bolt struck my horse.

Kellids of the Kamelands used to live here. We found a room with weapons and armor, which is mostly decayed.

A corpse lies, clutching a sword. Upon entering, it attacked us.

We killed it and the skeletons it summoned. It was wielding a +2 Faebane Cold Iron Bastard Sword. A gift from Ragathiel. But it's broken. It would cost 4500gp to repair.

We went to see Garrum the Boggart again and he directed us west to find his tribe.

We found a stinky pond, and a unicorn with a broken horn and milky white eyes. Unicorns usually cleanse tainted water, but they can also poison water.

Marlowe identified the spell that killed the unicorn as finger of death.

A unicorn horn can be used to cure disease, but also as a focus for necromancy spells.

Powerful fae creatures can kill in such a way that the corpse is repulsive to natural life.

Therefore, a powerful fae necromancer casted a finger of death to kill this unicorn, in order to take its horn to use as a focus.
